# Best_Scores_NBA_2023
This project uses a dataset which contains a list of all NBA players and their respective stats from the 2022-2023 season. Using this I added a new stat(true shooting) and combined it with other specifications to print out the players at each position who fit the criteria. 

The first project just gives an output of the best shooters in the league. 

The second project I used K means clustering to seperate the league into 5 types of shooters and graphed it on a line.
